# Python Code Blocks

Markdown preformatted code blocks with the `python` language identifier are
automatically converted to runnable and editable code blocks thanks
to [react-py](https://github.com/elilambnz/react-py).
See the react-py repo and documentation for more info.

For example, in a Markdown docs file:

````
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
````

Becomes:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Play and reset buttons appear when hovering over the code windows.

Non-runnable preformatted python blocks can be included by using `py` as the 
language identifier.

````
```py
print("Hello, World!")
```
````

Becomes:

```py
print("Hello, World!")
```


## Modifying the Default Code Editor / Runner

The `CodeEditor` component is located in `src/components/CodeEditor.js`.
This code editor uses font files located in `static/fonts` for the run and 
reset buttons. Modifying this will alter all code editing windows.

Cod windows are automatically inserted into documents by the modified 
`CodeBlock` theme component located in `src/theme/CodeBlock/index.js`. This 
is a good place to pass any global/default props to the `CodeEditor` 
component â€“ for example, globally setting the `showButtons` prop to have 
play and reset buttons always visible.

The `PythonProvider` required by `react-py` is located in the `Root` theme 
component in `src/theme/Root.js`. This is where lazy-loading or any other 
global `react-py` settings can be set.

## Notes

If you intend to have several runnable code windows on a single page, it is 
recommended to leave the react-py `lazy-loading` flag on. This means code 
runner workers are only spawned when a code block is run. Without this, it 
is likely several of the code windows will not work on weaker 
browsers/computers.
